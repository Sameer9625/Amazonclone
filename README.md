# Amazon Clone

This project is an Amazon clone that I designed to showcase my web development skills. The clone replicates the basic functionality of an e-commerce website and is built using HTML and CSS.

# Features

**Home Page**: A clean and responsive design that resembles Amazon's layout.
- **Product Listings**: A showcase of products with details like images, titles, and prices.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Basic Navigation**: Links to different sections of the site, such as the homepage, product categories, and cart.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the website.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and layout, ensuring a visually appealing design.
