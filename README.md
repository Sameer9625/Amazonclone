# Amazon Clone

This project is an Amazon clone that I designed to showcase my web development skills. The clone replicates the basic functionality of an e-commerce website and is built using HTML and CSS.

# Features

**Home Page**: A clean and responsive design that resembles Amazon's layout.
- **Product Listings**: A showcase of products with details like images, titles, and prices.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Basic Navigation**: Links to different sections of the site, such as the homepage, product categories, and cart.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the website.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and layout, ensuring a visually appealing design.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sameer9625/Sameer9625/amazon-clone.git
   cd amazon-clone
   ```

2. Open the project in your browser:

   Navigate to the project folder and open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Future Enhancements

- Add interactivity using JavaScript.
